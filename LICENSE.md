# Copyright and stuff

All my own software productions on this website may be used for non-commercial and educational purposes freely unless noted otherwise. It would be of great value if you notify me of additions/improvements.
For commercial uses, I generally don't make much of a problem either, but contact me anyway.
But please do not host my files for whatever reason without permission. (while my website is alive)

I might host or link to a few useful tools that are not mine, but I won't give extensive support on those. If you don't want it hosted/linked, please say so!
They should also contain their own copyright information in the archive file or somewhere else.
External links might be broken or point to harmful content. I don't do much checking of links. People just should not (re)move their webpages. Of course you can contact me if you need a link updated. I have a cool linking system around here and I'll add it to my website if I got the time :)
